    <h3>Veg biryani</h3>
   
    <a href="#">View Recipe</a>
    <div class="preparation">
      <h4>Preparation:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>First, rinse 1.5 cups of basmati rice (300 grams) in clean water until the water runs clear of starch. You can use a bowl or colander to rinse the rice. Make sure you soak the rice grains in water for 30 minutes after rinsing them.

        </li>
        <li>Once the rice has been able to soak for 30 minutes, drain all the water and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the basmati rice is soaking, use that time to prep the other ingredients. First, you will want to rinse, peel and chop all of the veggies. This will make the process of cooking go by much quicker.</li>
        <li> After you have organized and chopped all of your vegetables, it is time to cook the basmati rice. You can use any method to cook your rice – microwave, pressure cooking, instant pot or cooking in a pot.</li>
        <li>If cooking your rice in a pot, use a deep bottomed pan and add 5 cups water</li>
        <li>When the water is hot, add all the spices and 1 teaspoon salt. Here’s what you want to include for your veg dum biryani in this step:

          1 tej patta
          3 green cardamoms
          3 cloves
          1 black cardamom
          1 inch true cinnamon or 1 inch cassia cinnamon
          2 single strands of mace</li>
        <li> After adding the ingredients, bring the water to a boil on a high heat.</li>
        <li>Gently stir with a spoon or fork after you add the soaked basmati rice. Check the taste of water and ensure it is slightly salty.</li>
        <li>The rice should not be fully cooked, but a bit undercooked or about 75% or ¾ of the way cooked.</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon shah jeera (caraway seeds)
          1 tej patta
          3 green cardamoms
          3 cloves
          1 black cardamom
          1 inch cinnamon
          </li>
          <li>  Next, add the sliced onions.</li>
          <li> When the onions are cooking, take 1 cup fresh curd or yogurt in a bowl. Beat the curd with a spoon or whisk until it becomes smooth.</li>
          <li> Add the ginger-garlic paste and sliced green chilies. You can also finely chop the ginger-garlic and add if desired.</li>
          <li> Mix thoroughly and sauté veggies for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
          <li> Season with salt according to taste and mix again.</li>
      </ol>

  <h3>Palak Paneer </h3>
  <a href="#">View Recipe</a>
  <img src="palak-paneer.jpg" alt="veg Recipe 2">
  <div class="preparation">
    <h4>Preparation:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Pan Fry Paneer</li>
      <li>Cut the paneer into small pieces. Usually, I slice the block of paneer into about 1/3-inch slices. Then, I take each slice of paneer and cut it into smaller pieces. </li>
      <li>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of ghee or oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add half of the paneer pieces and pan fry until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle a small pinch of salt over the paneer before flipping them over. Then, pan fry the other side until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer the fried paneer to a plate</li>
      <li>Add another 1 1/2 tablespoons of ghee or oil to the skillet and repeat the pan frying step above. I’ve found that the second batch usually takes less time because the pan is quite hot at this point. Transfer the remaining fried paneer to the plate.</li>
      <li>Make Spinach Sauce</li>
      <li>Fill a large saucepan with about 3 quarts of water and bring it to boil. Add the baby spinach to the boiling water. If all of it doesn’t fit into the saucepan, add half of the spinach first. Once the spinach starts wilting, add the remaining spinach. Cook for about a minute, until all the spinach wilts.</li>
      <li>Use a spider spatula to remove the spinach from the saucepan or drain the spinach into a colander.  </li>
      <li>Transfer the spinach to a food processor. You don’t need to squeeze the excess liquid from the spinach beforehand. Blend the spinach for about 10 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and blend again for another 10 seconds. Leave the chopped spinach in the food processor </li>
      <li> Heat a large skillet with 2 tablespoons of ghee or safflower oil over medium-high heat. Add the diced onions and cook them for about 3 minutes, until they start to soften. Next, add the minced ginger, garlic, diced serrano pepper, and cumin seeds and cook for 30 seconds. Then, add the garam masala, turmeric, and cayenne pepper. Stir to coat the onions with the dried spices.</li>
      <li> Transfer the chopped spinach into the skillet. Next, add the heavy cream and salt. Cover the skillet with a lid and reduce the heat to medium. Let the spinach sauce simmer for about 5 minutes. </li>
      <li>Uncover the lid and add the pan-fried paneer to the spinach sauce. Turn off the heat. Serve the palak paneer with basmati rice. 
      </li>
